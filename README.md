# 🚀 How to Use

DiscoPeek requires a **backend** to work properly, using **Node.js** and the `server.js` file. Simply opening `index.html` in the browser will cause errors with fetching translations or making backend requests.

---

## 💻 Steps to Run the Site

1.  Make sure **Node.js** is installed.
2.  Open the **terminal** in the project's root folder.
3.  Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    ⚠️ By default, the site will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  Open your browser and navigate to **http://localhost:3000**.

Now the frontend can properly communicate with the backend, and all site features will work correctly.

### 💡 Important Tip

**Do not** open `index.html` directly (e.g., by double-clicking it). **Always** use the local server (`localhost`) to avoid errors with `fetch` requests and **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues.
